# Time Series Final Project

The repository covers a project which aims to understand the underlying factors involved in determining prices for cryptocurrencies. The end-goal is to use our knowledge of time series models to create sophisticated and accurate forecasts.

3.	Slides: A PowerPoint summarizing our project, process and findings and limitations of resulting model/models.

#### Detailed Project Description: 

The feasibility of models will be examined via an analysis on bitcoin prices - one of the most prevalent cryptocurrencies. The model architecture should be generalizable to cryptocurrencies with significant trading volumes. We will be modeling our data around the closing prices for any particular day which over a substantial period of time should not deviate from the daily patterns

When building our models we treat the data as time series models, under the assumption that this framework will yield better results.
